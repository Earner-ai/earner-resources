The basic unemployment allowance is payable for a maximum period of 400 days. If your employment history is less than three years, the maximum payment period is 300 days. If you are still unemployed when the allowance runs out, you can apply for labor market subsidy.

The unemployment allowance is payable for a maximum of 500 days for unemployed people 58 years old and older. Ageing unemployed people who satisfy the work requirement are eligible for additional days of unemployment allowance and can take advantage of a kind of unemployment path to retirement.

## Didn't you mention networking?

Yes. Networking, and meeting new people, can make a big difference when unemployed. "You can get a head by who you know". The same is true in Finland.

A few suggestions on getting started is to volunteer at events. A lot of big events will need volunteers. As a volunteer, not only will you get free access to the event, but you will meet new people who could help you get ahead.

Another suggestion is join websites, such as meetup.com, and attend the social gatherings listed there.

There are great networking groups on social media, who often have events where members can meet with each other.

In short, networking can make a big difference in your life. Not only are you gaining great friendships, but you could get a great recommendation for a job as well.

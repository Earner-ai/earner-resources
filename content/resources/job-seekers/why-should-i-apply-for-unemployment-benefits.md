If you become unemployed you can apply for unemployment benefits from Kela after you have registered as an unemployed job seeker at the TE Office (TE Palvelut). The benefits that can be paid to unemployed persons are:

1. Unemployment allowance (earnings-related unemployment allowance or basic unemployment allowance).

2. Labor market subsidy.

If you are a member of an unemployment fund you can apply for earnings related unemployment allowance from the unemployment fund. If you are not entitled to earnings related unemployment allowance, you can apply for basic unemployment allowance or labor market subsidy from Kela.

We couldn't find any official list of steps to take once a person becomes unemployed, but here are some suggestions.

1. Register with the TE Office (TE Palvelut) as an unemployed job seeker.

2. Apply for unemployment benefits from Kela.

3. Apply to jobs in your area of expertise.

4. Network as much as you can.

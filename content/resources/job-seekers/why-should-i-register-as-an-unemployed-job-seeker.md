Registering as an unemployed job seeker is the first step in applying for unemployment benefits. When you become unemployed, you must register at the latest on your first day of unemployment. You can also register later at any time, but you can't receive unemployment benefits until then. It should be noted that if you lose your job on a Monday and register as an unemployed job seeker on a Friday, you will only receive the unemployed benefits starting from Friday; the day you registered as a job seeker.

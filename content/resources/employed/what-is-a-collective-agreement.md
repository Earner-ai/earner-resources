A collective agreement is an agreement made by one or more employers, or an employers’ association with one or more employees’ unions, concerning conditions which must be complied with in contracts of employment or employment relationships. Collective agreements lay down the minimum terms of employment and "they oblige the parties to observe industrial peace".

The signed collective agreement, and the associated documents, must be submitted to the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health within one month of its signing. To learn more, click [here](https://tem.fi/en/collective-agreements-and-mediation-in-labour-disputes).

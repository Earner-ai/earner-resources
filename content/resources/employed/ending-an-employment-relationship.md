## Ending an employment relationship

The employer can not cancel an employment contract without a good reason. These reasons may be due to the employee or â€œeconomic and production-related reasons and a restructuring of the employer's operations''. An employee who has neglected their duties in the employment relationship may not be dismissed before a warning has been issued and they have thus had a chance of rectifying the neglect.

## Why should I join an unemployment fund?

Unemployment funds are a nice security blanket in case you are laid off, or terminated, from your job. The unemployment fund will provide you with a earnings related daily allowance based on your previous employment salary, among other factors. In most cases to qualify for the unemployment fund, you must have been a member of the unemployment fund organization for at least 26 weeks before becoming unemployed. You will also need to be registered as an unemployed job seeker at the TE Office.

## Can't I just quit my job?

We've all been there. We have that job we just don't want to stay at anymore. Quitting sounds like an easy escape, but it might not be as easy as you think. Review your employment contract and the Employment Contracts Act to see what your options are. Additionally, leaving, or "resigning", from your job may disqualify you from receiving government sponsored unemployment benefits or provide you with a reduced amount. To review the Employment Contracts Act, click [here](http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/2001/en20010055.pdf).

Please do your research and call TE Palvelut or Kela to see what they have to say regarding your options.

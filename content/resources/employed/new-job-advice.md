## I'm about to start a new job. Any advice?

1. Within the first week of employment, sign an employment contract with your employer. If they donâ€™t provide you one, you can bring your own contract by using a template. To see an example template, <a href="https://www.tyosuojelu.fi/documents/95118/1478089/Contract_of_employment">click here</a>.

For more information about employement contracts, please <a href="http://www.te-palvelut.fi/te/en/jobseekers/finding_job/employment_relationship/beginning_employment/index.html#Enteringintoanemploymentcontract">click here</a>.

2. Join a labor union that services your area of employment and/or an unemployment fund.

3. Update your tax information.

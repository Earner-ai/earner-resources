## Tell me more about employment contracts.

Employment contracts are very important. The _Employment Contracts Act_ aims to protect the rights of employers and employees. The contract ensures the employee will work for their employer until the end of their contract, unless otherwise specified, while making sure the employees get their due salary. Employee contracts are binding and often involve trial periods, enclose employee salary details, the date when the contract expires, and other additional agreements made by the employer.

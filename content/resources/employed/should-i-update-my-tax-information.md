When you get a new job and your level of income changes, or if the estimated total income needs to be changed, you will need a new tax card. You should request a new tax card if you change jobs, become unemployed, etc.

When you submit a request for a new tax card, you can also report some deductible expenses that you must pay the given year, so that they can be taken into account and will lower your withholding rate.

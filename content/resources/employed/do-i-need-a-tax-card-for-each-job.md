## I have more than one job. Do I need a tax card for each job?

No. Only one tax card is needed and you'll use that tax card for every job. Your tax card has one income ceiling for all your income during the year.

When you request a new tax card, you'll estimate how much income you'll receive during the year. Give your income, for every job, in the same section. You don't have to divide your income into primary and secondary income.

If you decide to start a business while unemployed, you can still continue to receive unemployment benefit payments for another 4 months.

The Kela unemployment benefit is affected by the income from your self-employment, which means the more money you make from your business, the less money you get from Kela. You will need to report your self-employment income in the unemployment status report. To learn more, click [here](https://www.kela.fi/web/en/adjusted-unemployment-benefit).

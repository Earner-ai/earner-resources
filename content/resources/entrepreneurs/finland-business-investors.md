An investor is a person who believes in your product or services and is convinced that your company will do well in the long run. So they say they'll pay you a certain amount of money in exchange for a percentage of your company. This investment money can help you further develop your product and pay your salary. What the money can be used for may have limites, depending on the investor.

Of course investors want to make money back. This is usually done if you were to exit (or sell) your company. "What is your exit strategy?" will be often asked from interested investors when speaking with them. So have an answer prepared in advance. Psst... you don't have to sell your company if you don't want to.
